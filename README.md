# ECE-304---Junior-Design-Project
Final Project from ECE 304 - Junior Design Project

For this project, I created a system for a receptionist desk to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. It is run via an Atmega 328p. The system uses a sonar sensor to measure how far a person is from the desk and displays it to them via a 7-segment, 4-digit display. A red LED flashes when the person is within 6 feet, indicating that they need to back up. Similarly, a green LED turns on when the person is farther than 6 feet away indicating that they are at a safe distance. There is also an OLED display in the back (facing the receptionist) that shows the closest a person has approached the counter.
